├── App.jsx                   # Root component — holds all shared state

└── main.jsx                  # React entry point
```

## Why This Structure

**All state in App.jsx** — The app has three pieces of state: `cart`, `selectedCategory`, and `orderPlaced`. Lifting state to `App.jsx` keeps data flow simple and unidirectional (no prop tunneling deeper than two levels). This is appropriate for a project of this scope; a context or external store would be over-engineering.

**ProductListing owns its own filter state** — `selectedCategory` only affects which products are visible and nothing else in the app needs to know about it, so it lives locally inside `ProductListing` rather than being hoisted to `App`.

**Flat component folder** — No sub-folders inside `components/` because there are only 6 components. Adding nesting would add navigation overhead without benefit at this scale.

**Plain CSS, no framework** — A single `App.css` file with CSS custom properties covers all styling needs cleanly. Avoiding Tailwind or CSS Modules keeps the project dependency-light and straightforward to read.
